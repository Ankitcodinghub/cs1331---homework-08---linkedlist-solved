Problem Description

Welcome to your final challenge, er- I mean, final homework! For this homework, you will be writing a concrete implementation of a List ADT‚Äìa Singly-Linked List. LinkedLists are comprised of Nodes, which are objects that store data and have a pointer to the next Node in the list, which has its own data and next Node, and so on.

Solution Description

We have provided List.java (different than the List interface from java.util package), an abstract data type (ADT) that contains abstract methods for all of the functionality your LinkedList needs to implement. Using your knowledge of Collections, Generics, and Iterable, you will write a Node class that represents a singular element in a LinkedList and a LinkedList class that represents a Singly-LinkedList and implements all of the functionality defined in the provided List&lt;T&gt; interface. As always, you will need to adhere to proper Checkstyle including Javadocs.

Node.java

Your LinkedList will consist of Nodes. Each Node will contain its own data and point to the next Node in the list. This class takes in a generic type parameter for the type of data the Node will hold, so be sure to reflect that in your class declaration, instance data, and methods. Make sure that this is a separate file from your LinkedList class.

‚Ä¢ Variables

o data

This represents the data stored in the Node

Should be of generic type o Node next

This represents the Node that comes next in the list

This Node‚Äôs data type will be of the same generic type as data

‚Ä¢ Constructors o A constructor that takes values in the following order: data and next and assigns them to the corresponding instance variables.

o A constructor that takes in a data value and sets next to null.

‚Ä¢ Methods

o Getters and setters for all instance variables.

LinkedList.java

This file contains your implementation of a Singly-LinkedList. This class takes in a generic type parameter for the type of data each Node in the LinkedList will hold, so be sure to reflect that in your class declaration, instance data, and methods. Your Singly-LinkedList should store Nodes and implement the provided List&lt;T&gt; interface

‚Ä¢ Variables

o Node head

Represents the head of your LinkedList

If the LinkedList is empty, should be null

o int size

Represents the number of Nodes in your LinkedList

Remember to update size accordingly as you add to and remove from the

LinkedList

‚Ä¢ Constructors o A no-argument constructor that initializes head to null and size to 0

‚Ä¢ Methods

o Override all methods in the provided List&lt;T&gt; interface

For all methods that take in parameters you should throw the following Exceptions if the parameters are invalid:

ÔÉ† Throw an IllegalArgumentException if any parameters are null

ÔÉ† Throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException if an index parameter is invalid

Make sure to read the JavaDocs in the List&lt;T&gt; interface so you know what functionality to implement.

o To implement the iterator() method you should write an inner class named

LinkedListIterator and return an instance of it. The LinkedListIterator class should contain the following.

This class should not be generic, but should utilize the generic type from LinkedList as needed.

This class should implement Iterator&lt;T&gt; and override all non-default abstract methods in the Iterator&lt;T&gt; interface

ÔÉ† Make sure to throw a NoSuchElementException from the abstract method stated in the Iterator&lt;T&gt; API to throw one when an error occurs

This class should have one instance variable named nextNode of type Node to keep track of the next element in the LinkedList.

This class should have one no-argument constructor that initializes nextNode to head.

o Getters for the instance variables.

Clarifications and Example Output

Allowed Imports

‚Ä¢ java.util.Iterator

‚Ä¢ java.util.NoSuchElementException

Feature Restrictions

There are a few features and methods in Java that overly simplify the concepts we are trying to teach or break our auto grader. For that reason, do not use any of the following in your final submission:

‚Ä¢ var‚ÄØ(the reserved keyword)

‚Ä¢ System.exit

Checkstyle and Javadocs

You must run Checkstyle on your submission. The Checkstyle cap for this assignment is 15 points. If you don‚Äôt have Checkstyle yet, download it from Canvas -&gt; Modules -&gt; Checkstyle Resources (all sections). Place it in the same folder as the files you want Checkstyled. Run checkstyle on your code like so:

$ java -jar checkstyle-8.28.jar yourFileName.java Starting audit‚Ä¶

Audit done.

The message above means there were no Checkstyle errors. If you had any errors, they would show up above this message, and the number at the end would be the points we would take off (limited by the Checkstyle cap mentioned above). The Java source files we provide contain no Checkstyle errors. In future homeworks we will be increasing this cap, so get into the habit of fixing these style errors early!

Additionally, you must Javadoc your code.

Run the following to only check your Javadocs:

$ java -jar checkstyle-8.28.jar -j yourFileName.java

Run the following to check both Javadocs and Checkstyle:

$ java -jar checkstyle-8.28.jar -a yourFileName.java

For additional help with Checkstyle see the CS 1331 Style Guide.

Collaboration

No collaboration is allowed on this assignment. See syllabus for more details.

Turn-In Procedure

Submission

To submit, upload the files listed below to the corresponding assignment on‚ÄØGradescope:

‚Ä¢ Node.java

‚Ä¢ LinkedList.java

Please only submit the individual files‚Äîdo not put them into a package or you will risk getting a zero on the assignment. Make sure you see the message stating ‚ÄúHW08 submitted successfully‚Äù. From this point,‚ÄØGradescope‚ÄØwill run a basic‚ÄØautograder‚ÄØon your submission as discussed in the next section.

Gradescope‚ÄØAutograder

For each submission, you will be able to see the results of a few basic test cases on your code. Each test typically corresponds to a rubric item, and the score returned represents the performance of your code on those rubric items only. If you fail a test, you can look at the output to determine what went wrong and resubmit once you have fixed the issue.

The‚ÄØGradescope‚ÄØtests serve two main purposes:

‚Ä¢ Prevent upload mistakes (e.g.‚ÄØnon-compiling code)

‚Ä¢ Provide basic formatting and usage validation

In other words, the test cases on‚ÄØGradescope‚ÄØare by no means comprehensive. Be sure to thoroughly test your code by considering edge cases and writing your own test files. You also should avoid using‚ÄØGradescope‚ÄØto compile, run, or‚ÄØCheckstyle‚ÄØyour code; you can do that locally on your machine.

Important Notes‚ÄØ(Don‚Äôt Skip)

‚Ä¢ Non-compiling files will receive a 0 for all associated rubric items

‚Ä¢ Do not submit‚ÄØ.class‚ÄØfiles

‚Ä¢ Test your code in addition to the basic checks on‚ÄØGradescope

‚Ä¢ Run‚ÄØCheckstyle‚ÄØon your code to avoid losing points

‚Ä¢ Submit every file each time you resubmit

‚Ä¢ Read the ‚ÄúAllowed Imports‚Äù and ‚ÄúFeature Restrictions‚Äù to avoid losing points

‚Ä¢ Check on Piazza for a note containing all official clarifications
